This work is the visual representation of individual tax contributions and the breakdown of where it is spent through the National Budget.

The most important document any government releases is the National Budget, unfortunately we believe the current state of access to this document is not up to par with what society needs. It is freely and relatively easy to access, however, the shear scale and complexity of the budget scares off the average citizen.

Our project My Money's Worth is designed to increase the accessibility of the budget and create a relatable interface for individuals.
